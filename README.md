Customer segmentation is a powerful marketing technique that involves dividing a customer base into distinct segments based on shared characteristics, behaviours, or demographics. The primary purpose of customer segmentation is to better understand and serve customers in a more personalized and targeted way. Marketing segmentation helps to understand customer needs better and reach the right customer with right messaging.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a necessary preliminary step before using a segmentation algorithm.
